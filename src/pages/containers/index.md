## Containers

Containers are an operating-system-level virtualization. It is an operating system feature in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances. Such instances, called containers may look like real computers from the point of view of programs running in them.
In short, operating systems were virtualized as a means of allowing us to optimize the overall usage of our computing resources. Dedicated hardware, in most cases, sat largely idle over 99% of every day with occasional usage spikes when an application/site peaked in use.
As a result, we can now run many virtualized operating systems on one physical host.
